# Scientific Calculator

I created this scientific calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator supports a wide range of different mathematical functions, from basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to advanced features like trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, permutations, combinations and more.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

In this project, I used HTML to structure the content, CSS to ensure styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions and to solve mathematical expressions. To achieve the mathematical computations, I used various built-in functions in JavaScript, such as eval() and the functions like Math.log(), Math.PI, Math.sin(), and others. Additionally, I applied the concept of regular expressions to handle expressions within the project.

## Getting Started

## Known Issues

Although I have tried my best to replicate the features of the mobile inbuilt calculator, it cannot handle all complex expressions perfectly. However, these complex mathematical expressions can be easily handled using regular expressions in JavaScript, but due to limited time, I did not do so.
